# Compound Interest
This is a simple java application to calculate the compound interest of something. 


#### What I've learned

- Math.pow() is used to calculate a number which is raise to the power of any variety of another number.
```java
import static java.lang.Math.pow;

```

- Scanner class in java is used to obtain primitive data types such as int, double, string, char, etc. It uses the java.util package in order to 'scan' for user input instead of using the 'get' and 'set' methods.
```java
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

```
